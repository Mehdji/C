## 📖 About this repository
This repository contains my personal practice and solutions to exercises inspired by  
**_The C Programming Language_ (K&R)** by **Brian W. Kernighan** and **Dennis M. Ritchie**.

I’m using this space to deepen my understanding of **C** as a foundational language for computer science, even outside the context of embedded systems (which I’m also open to exploring in the future).
